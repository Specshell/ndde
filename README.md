Project Description
This library provides a convenient and easy way to integrate .NET applications with legacy applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE). DDE is an older interprocess communication protocol that relies heavily on passing windows messages back and forth between applications. Other, more modern and robust, techniques for interprocess communication are available and should be used when available. This library is only intended to be used when no other alternatives exist.

This project is not actively developed or maintained anymore.

## Adoptions from original
* Removed Thread.Sleep from DdeClient.cs that was only used for logging but made the client incredibly slow.
* Disabled logging (see bullet 1)
* Changed standard Encoding in DdeContext.cs from ASCII to ANSI
